&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `The administration part consists of 4 types of managers who can enter the system`  

1- `Admin`  :    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Admin will have access to everything in the system,he can see any links or make any action Gym Manager   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and City Manager can do with these extra functionalities.    

2- `City Manager` :    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; City Manager can do what Gym Manager do with extra functionalities â€¦ like he can see all gyms in his city and  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; make CRUD on any gym or gym manager in his city.  

3- `Gym Managers` :  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gym Manager can CRUD training sessions and assign coaches to these sessions, also he can buy training  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; package for a user through stripe.  

4- `coach` :  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can only see the sessions in which he trains.  

5- `User` (It will be API only) :  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cann't access the system because it is for the administration only, but there is an endpoint (API) for the user.   

instalation:
 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run migration to create dababas tables use a command ` $ php artisan migrate `.

`Step 6` :    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run data seed to create fake data in your database use a command ` $ php artisan db:seed `.  

OR you can shorten the previous two steps (5 , 6) by using this command ` $ php artisan migrate:fresh --seed `.  


- Now `226` Accounts have been created on the system, distributed as follows :  
The first two accounts are for `admin`.    
From 3 to 26 are `cityManager`.  
From 27 to 66 are `gymManager`.  
From 67 to 126 are `coach`.  
From 127 to 226 are `user`.  
All created accounts have a unified password `123456`.  


  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To create a new admin account use a command  

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ` $ php artisan create:admin --email=admin2@admin.com --password=123456 `.  

`Step 8`:    
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Run schedule use a command `php artisan schedule:work`   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then use a command `php artisan notify:users-not-logged-in-for-month`
